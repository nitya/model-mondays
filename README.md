![Model Mondays](./img/model-mondays-banner.png)

As an AI native engineer, your journey starts with model choice. But with 10K+ models in Microsoft Foundry, 2M+ open-source model in Hugging Face, and new model releases every day, _how do you make informed decisions?_ With Model Mondays, we have three resources to help you go from awareness to action to adoption.

1. [Model Mondays livestream](https://aka.ms/model-mondays/rsvp) - every Monday at 1:30pm EST with news, tech spotlights & customer stories
1. [Foundry Friday AMA](https://aka.ms/model-mondays/discord) - every Monday at 1:30pm EST with demos, Q&A featuring subject matter experts
1. [Models For Beginners](https://aka.ms/models-for-beginners) - curriculum launching Dec 2025 with 4 tracks and weekly lesson updates.

**Build your Model IQ** one week at a time - and go from scenario to solution by learning model fundamentals, understanding model selection, exploring model customization, and building trustworthy AI solutions with end-to-end observability. Join us by taking two actions today:

1. [Join the Discord](https://aka.ms/model-mondays/discord) - and follow the _#model-mondays_ channel for regular updates!
1. [Register for the Livestream](https://aka.ms/model-mondays/rsvp) - and watch for new updates to the schedule in 2026

<br/>

## Season 3: Dec 2025 - Apr 2026

With 21 livestream episodes and 31 AMA sessions completed, we now have a well-defined format that has resonated with AI native engineers and decision-makers alike. As we began planning Season 3, we thought about how we could use the platform to support one additional audience: _learners_. 

Over the next four months, we'll end each episode with a look at one lesson or lab from "Models For Beginners" (MFB), the latest addition to our popular _For-Beginners_ curricula. This content is derived from labs and workshops delivered at signature Microsoft events like AI Tour, Build and Ignite - and gives you a structured way to explore and understand Microsoft Foundry features through the lens of a common app scenario and rich developer tools.

**Learn more at our kickoff - and watch for updates throughout the season.**

### Season 3: Full Schedule

The main schedule for Season 3 will kickoff in January 2026, after the holiday break.
