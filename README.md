With 21 livestream episodes and 31 AMA sessions completed, we now have a well-defined format that has resonated with AI native engineers and decision-makers alike. As we began planning Season 3, we thought about how we could use the platform to support one additional audience: _learners and partners_. In 2026, look for new segments like _Partner Spotlights_ featuring model providers, _This Week In Hugging Face_ spotlighting open-source models, and _Study Corner_ showcasing self-guided labs and curricula for skilling.
