**Title:** Advanced Reasoning Models AMA

**Speakers:** 
- Nitya Narasimhan (Host)
- Marlene Mhangami
- Sharmila Chockalingam

**Description:** Join us for an AMA on Advanced Reasoning Models with Marlene Mhangami. Explore how models like DeepSeek R1 and the o-series from Azure OpenAI are pushing the boundaries of problem-solving, research, and decision-making.

## Topics Discussed
- Reasoning models architecture
- DeepSeek R1 implementation
- Chain-of-thought techniques
- Multi-agent systems
- Knowledge graphs and RAG
- Reducing hallucinations
- Local vs cloud deployment
- Model evaluation strategies
