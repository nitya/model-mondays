## 3. Customer Story: Healow Health

_This week’s customer spotlight featured [Healow Health](https://www.healow.com/)—a healthcare technology company using Azure AI to boost efficiency for doctors, staff, and patients._

![S2E11 Banner](../../assets/customer-stories/S2-E11.png)

**How Hilo Uses Azure AI:**
- **Document Management:**  
  Automates fax/document filing, splits multi-page faxes by patient, reduces staff effort and errors using [Azure Computer Vision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview) and [Document Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/overview).
- **Ambient Listening:**  
  [Ambient clinical note transcription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/conversation-transcription) captures doctor-patient conversations and summarizes them for easy EHR documentation.
- **Genie AI Contact Center:**  
  Agentic voice assistants handle patient calls, book appointments, answer billing/refill questions, escalate to humans, and assist human agents—using [Azure Communication Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/), [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/), [FastAPI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure/azure-quickstart-templates/fastapi-on-azure-app-service/) (community), and [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview/).
- **Conversational Campaigns:**  
  Outbound reminders, procedure preps, and follow-ups all handled by voice AI—freeing up human staff.

**Impact:**  
Hilo reaches 16,000+ physician practices and 180,000 providers, automates millions of communications, and processes $2B+ in payments annually—demonstrating how multimodal AI transforms patient journeys from first call to post-visit care.

## Sharda's Tips: How I Wrote This Blog

I organize key moments from each episode, highlight product demos and customer stories, and use [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot) for structure. For this recap, I tested the [Speech Playground](https://ai.azure.com/explore/aiservices/speech) myself, explored the docs, and summarized answers to common developer questions on security, dialects, and deployment.

Here’s my favorite Copilot prompt this week:

> "Generate a technical blog post for Model Mondays S2E11 based on the transcript and episode details. Focus on Azure Speech Playground, TTS, avatars, Voice Live API, and healthcare use cases. Add practical links for developers and students!"
